    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p>I am Ashvika Sista and one of my favorite hobbies is creating things. I enjoy this because i get to experiment with many diffrent materials from acrylic paint to clay.I have always enjoyed painting and sketching. sometimes I do more showpeice things and othertimes, my work has meaning. I have always used painting as a way of expressing myself and recently i have been experimenting with other materials. I have started to use cardboard to make diffrent gifts and prodjects ad has used materials I didnt even know were a thing. I have never really liked showing if I am in pain of if im upset and I am glad that I found a way to let my emotions become somthing beautiful.
